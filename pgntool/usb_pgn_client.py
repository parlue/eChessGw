"""
eChessGw USB PGN client.

Second, independent retrieval path for recorded games (see
include/usb_pgn_dump.h in the firmware) -- built because the BLE-based
Chess PGN Master download is blocked on an undocumented protocol step, with
no ETA on a fix. This client and the firmware side define both ends of
their own simple protocol, so there's nothing to reverse-engineer here.

Usage: plug the gateway into this PC via USB (it's powered from the same
cable), place a standard starting position on the board with one extra
white queen on c4 ("queen gesture"). The firmware dumps every saved game
over the serial link; this client saves each one as its own gameN.pgn file
in the directory this script/exe lives in, auto-numbered from whatever
gameN.pgn files are already there.

Protocol (plain text over the same serial link the firmware's normal debug
log already uses -- other lines are simply ignored):

    ###PGN_USB_DUMP_BEGIN count=N###
    ###PGN_FILE_BEGIN index=0 bytes=341###
    <exact raw .pgn file content, `bytes` bytes>
    ###PGN_FILE_END###
    ... (repeated for each saved game, index 0..N-1)
    ###PGN_USB_DUMP_END###

If, and only if, every one of the N games above was saved with its exact
expected byte count (no framing errors), this client writes one line back:

    ###PGN_USB_DUMP_ACK###

which tells the gateway it's safe to delete those N games from its own
storage (added 2026-09-02, per the user's own plan -- previously the
gateway never deleted anything and games only wrapped around after 20 new
ones). A partial/failed transfer sends no ack at all, so the gateway's own
timeout just leaves everything in place for the next attempt.
