// Driver for the Cynus robot's own BLE protocol (service 0xFFF0 / char
// 0xFFF1, line-based text commands). This is a port of the user's own
// proven CynusLink project (C:\Users\DirkSommerfeld\Documents\CynusLink_Test),
// which bridges the exact same Cynus robot to a real chess computer over its
// OWN BLE "MILLENNIUM CHESS" server role and is confirmed to hold full games
// with King. Here the chess computer (King/Phoenix) is instead on our
// project's cable side, so only CynusLink's chess/game logic is ported --
// its own BLE-server transport (sendCL) is replaced by this project's
// existing cable pipeline (onBoardStatusFrame()/writeFrameToKing() in
// main.cpp), which already handles acks, checksums and framing generically
// for every board driver.

// "8/P4K2/2PpnP2/2p5/2N5/p6k/8/8"). Returns false immediately if the string
// isn't a valid 64-square placement or an experimental mode is active;
// Cynus's own asynchronous "illegal FEN" reply is the second rejection path.
